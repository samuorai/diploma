This is a draft for every word the instructor says, sorry for the bad handwriting but i did it asa fast as i could.
these drafts represents the most valuable ideas and tips to me, and i hope it becomes a handy information that helps the beginners like
me to reach the desired level they want.
if there is any doubts or thoughts someone wants to ask, don't hesitate to ask and i'll try my best to answer with the limited knowledge i have.
if i didn't get the answer, be sure that i'll do my best to find it for you.
thanks.
remember: this is for the future me " you made it, don't stop till the last breath"
